## About The Project

In order to harness the true potential of NestJS, GraphQL, and TypeORM, I needed a way to dynamically fetch child relationships based on the GraphQL query coming in, without having to write a resolver specific to each entity and limited in depth. I went searching for a solution and found [this thread](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/issues/405). 
A solution had been posted by [david-eos](https://github.com/david-eos), but it wasn't functional enough to integrate easily into a proper NestJS + TypeORM + @nestjs/graphql project. I re-worked his solution into a portable and lightweight package generalizable enough to be used by anyone.

### Built With

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [GraphQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql)
* [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/)

## Getting Started

This plugin is light-weight and easy to install and use.

### Installation

```sh
npm i --save perch-query-builder@latest
```

## Use inside your resolver

```TS
@Query(of => [classRef], {
    name: `findAll${classRef.name}`,
    description: `Generic Collection Query For ${classRef.name}`,
    nullable: true,
})
protected async getAll(
    @Context() ctx,
    @Info() info: GraphQLResolveInfo,
): Promise<T[]> {
    // Simply pass your entity's repository, and the GraphQLResolve Info
    return await PerchQueryBuilder.find<T>(this.repository, info);
}
```
